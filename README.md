MGB-SED is an open-source plugin for QGIS that extends the capabilities of the MGB (Large Basin Model) hydrological model, enabling integrated simulation of sediment transport in rivers and watersheds. This module allows users to obtain the necessary inputs, perform hydro-sedimentological modeling, and visualize the results intuitively.

The MGB-SED QGIS Plugin is currently classified as experimental software (alpha/beta).

Although we have made every effort to ensure its functionality, you are likely to encounter bugs, unexpected behavior, or incomplete functionality. We strongly recommend:

Use caution when using this plugin for critical analysis or decision-making without carefully validating the results.

Be aware that things can go wrong. The interface may crash, processes may fail, or results may be incorrect.

We greatly value your testing and feedback. By using the plugin, you are helping us identify and fix problems. Please report any issues you encounter on our Issues page.

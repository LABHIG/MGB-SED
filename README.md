# MGB-SED
MGB-SED is an open-source plugin for QGIS that extends the capabilities of the MGB (Large Basin Model) hydrological model, enabling integrated simulation of sediment transport in rivers and watersheds. This module allows users to obtain the necessary inputs, perform hydro-sedimentological modeling, and visualize the results intuitively.
